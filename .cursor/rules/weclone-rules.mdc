# Your rule content
- You can @ files here
- The project uses uv as the package manager and pyproject.toml as the project configuration file.
- Unless I ask you to, code comments don't need to be excessive.
- Prefer using the encapsulated logger `from weclone.utils.log import logger` for printing.
- Comments should prioritize the use of English.
